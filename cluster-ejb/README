EJB clustering example using remote clustered stateful and stateless session bean.
Client waits 3 seconds to call the EJB.
Run two server instance with commands
server1/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml  -Djboss.node.name=jboss1 
server2/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml  -Djboss.node.name=jboss2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100

When one server is shutdown, the client will continue to process to the clustered server without throwing exception back to the client.
The code is tested using JBoss 7.2 and JBoss EAP 6.1.
Since there are ejb client bugs found in these two releases, please upgrade the modules to use jboss-ejb-client 1.0.22.Final
and jboss-remoting 3.2.16.GA.
